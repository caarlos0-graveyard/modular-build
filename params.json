{"name":"Modular-build","tagline":"Modular build scripts relying on GNU Make.","body":"# modular-build\r\n\r\nBasically, a `Makefile` and some base things to do modular GNU Make\r\ntasks for any project, because doing same things lots of times is\r\nfucking boring and I hate this.\r\n\r\nI originally created this here at [Fluig][0] with contributions of\r\n[@lucasmerencia][1] to use with our project, but I decided that it\r\nwould be cool to share the structure with other people.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nJust run in your app root (with `wget`):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nwget -qO- http://git.io/63HVSg | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nor with `curl`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl -s http://git.io/63HVSg | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will clone this repo in a `scripts` folder inside your app folder.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to create a `test` task. We have to do 3 simple steps:\r\n\r\n1. Run `make newtask` (inform name `test`);\r\n1. Edit your script (`scripts/test.sh`);\r\n1. Run `make test` and GNU Make will do the rest for you.\r\n\r\nIf you want to group a lot of tasks in one task, for example, `test` and\r\n`anotherthing`:\r\n\r\n```Makefile\r\nall: test anotherthing\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n- You can call a lot of scripts once: `make one two three` (and with a custom order);\r\n- Autocomplete in task names;\r\n- Variables and functions sharing between scripts (`base.sh`), a good example is\r\nthat you can share a custom `$MAVEN_OPTS` between scripts;\r\n- Easy to add new scripts (as described above).\r\n\r\n## Pitfals\r\n\r\n- If you already have a `scripts` folder, you will have some problems. You can just backup\r\nyour existent `scripts`, install this, and then copy back your old files, or simply\r\nmanually install modular-build;\r\n- It will probably not work in NTFS filesystems due to NTFS file permissions.\r\n\r\n## Help?\r\n\r\n[twitter](http://twitter.com/caarlos0) |\r\n[github](http://github.com/caarlos0) |\r\n[site](http://carlosbecker.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n[0]: http://www.fluig.com/\r\n[1]: http://github.com/lucasmerencia\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
